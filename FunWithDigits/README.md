# FunWithDigits
AppThis Coding Example

justin@rocketscience.cc

From	the	array	of	n	`digits`,	create	two	`numbers`	where	the	digits	are	split	up	as	evenly	as	possible	across	the	two	numbers	and	the	sum	of	those	two	numbers	is	the	highest	possible	value	from	any	combination	of	the	n	non-repeated	digits.		You	cannot	use	the	same	digit	more	than	once	and	each	digit	must	be	used.	


## Usage

    git clone https://github.com/turbohoje/FunWithDigits.git
    cd FunWithDigits
    mvn install
    ./run.sh

If you build this with intellij, then you might just want to run/runTests from inside intellij.  The pom/iml may have differing output based on config that is not handled in run.sh

### Interacting with shell
Enter ? or ?list to list the commands.  They are as follows.
```
FunWithDigits> ?list
abbrev	name	params
q	quit	()
d	get-digits-from-user	(p1)
gm	get-m	()
sm	set-m	(p1)
```

This lists the shorthand command along with if it takes an argument.  

    d 942790
is how you would run the first example in the assignment.
